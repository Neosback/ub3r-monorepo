/**
 * Per-client inbound mailbox that preserves ordering for transactional packets
 * while collapsing superseding input families.
 *
 * The FIFO bucket is itself split into two independently-budgeted lanes (rsprot's
 * client-event/user-event split, adapted to this protocol): [Family.ACTION] for
 * packets that represent a direct, single player-intended game action (bank ops,
 * object/npc/item interactions, buttons, trade/duel requests) and [Family.BACKGROUND]
 * for lower-urgency chatter (chat, friends/ignore list edits, bank-search keystrokes,
 * dropdowns, focus changes). Each lane has its own capacity so a flood of one can
 * never crowd out the other's slots, and [pollNext] always drains ACTION before
 * BACKGROUND so gameplay-critical input isn't stuck behind e.g. a burst of bank
 * search keystrokes.
