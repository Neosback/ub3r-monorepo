/**
 * rsprot-style fan-out/join worker for per-viewer sync encoding (mirrors
 * DefaultProtocolWorker): below [asynchronousThreshold] viewers the work runs inline
 * on the game thread — bitwise-identical to the historical sequential path — and above
 * it the per-viewer callables are submitted to [ForkJoinPool.commonPool] as one
 * submit-and-join barrier.
 *
 * Safety contract (verified against the pipeline):
 *  - PREP phases (shared block caches, viewport snapshots) complete before this runs.
 *  - Encode scratch is thread-local; each pooled worker lazily gets its own.
 *  - Each action must be self-isolating (the encode loops already try/catch per viewer
 *    and only mark that one viewer disconnected on failure).
 *  - [SynchronizationContext] is ThreadLocal, so the current cycle is re-bound inside
 *    every pooled task and cleared afterwards (pool threads are reused).
 *
 * Kill-switch: env SYNC_PARALLEL_ENCODE=false forces the inline path.
